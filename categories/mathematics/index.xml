As I understand now, in Book I, Euclid introduces three sets of foundational statements that serve as the basis for the geometric principles and proofs that follow.
Definitions are the first set of foundational statements that clarify the meanings of fundamental geometric terms. This helped me understand the rules behind what seemed previously like obvious conclusions.</description></item></channel></rss>
