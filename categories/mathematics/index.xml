&lt;p>This is my first experience with the formal study of mathematics in an attempt to fundamentally understand ideas that feel so dim to me.
As I understand now, in Book I, Euclid introduces three sets of foundational statements that serve as the basis for the geometric principles and proofs that follow.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Definitions&lt;/strong> are the first set of foundational statements that clarify the meanings of fundamental geometric terms. This helped me understand the rules behind what seemed previously like obvious conclusions. It struck me that a figure is essentially a description of a set of rules. For example, of the trilateral figures, an equilateral triangle has three equal sides; an isosceles triangle has two equal sides; and a scalene triangle has three unequal sides. However you adjust their lengths, they will always be descriptions of these rules.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
